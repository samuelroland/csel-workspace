  *Note on the Development Environment*

  This report was produced outside of the official course Docker environment
  (Ubuntu 24.04). All laboratories were completed natively on *Fedora 42*, a
  Linux distribution shipping significantly more recent package versions than
  those present in the reference container.

  This deliberate choice was made with the goal of getting the most out of the
  course and deepening understanding, by directly confronting the challenges of
  a real environment rather than a preconfigured and isolated one.
  *This approach is however not recommended* for students wishing to follow the
  course under optimal conditions, as the official Docker environment remains
  the reference for reproducing expected results without additional difficulty.

  This difference in environment caused several incompatibilities during the
  compilation and configuration of tools. Each issue encountered has been
  documented, along with the additional steps required to resolve it. These
  additional sections are clearly identified throughout the report to distinguish
  them from content strictly related to the laboratory objectives. This detailed
  documentation is intentional: it may serve as a reference for future students
  who also wish to work outside the official container.

  The results obtained remain functionally equivalent to those expected in the
  standard environment.
